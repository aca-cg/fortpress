I wanted a simple blog to be able to express myself, to share, to discover, to exchange. And that's it. A secure blog, based on the same technologies as Hackmyfortress.com. The basic principles are always the same:
* security
* efficiency
* simplicity
* modularity

# A solid blog like rock : Fortpress

In the past, I have audited Wordpress plugins, Joomla plugins, Drupal plugins .... The observation is always the same: many security vulnerabilities, problems of updates, a horrible slowness. I regularly help friends optimize their Wordpress: databases of more than 2GB, cache files everywhere, plugins not compatible with the current version of Wordpress. A nightmare.

So I took the initiative to code a blog as I wished: simple, light, and secure.
